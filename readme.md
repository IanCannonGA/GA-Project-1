*1. Technologies Used*

    1.1. HTML: Construction of basic layout, with each element separately ID'd for CSS, including top title line & reset, reels & lever, and credit & betting readouts & controls
    
    1.2. CSS: Styling applied to ID tagged elements, including CSS-Grid layout technique, bordering, background & text color

    1.3 JS: Creation of virtual "reel" for CONSTANTS (random/final readouts of each reel-window, payout values for each reel element), STATE Variables (credits, wager, reel array), CACHED Elements (controls and displays), EVENT Listeners (reset, lever, bet buttons), and FUNCTIONS (bet 1, bet max, reset, and lever-pull(which in turn passes reel array to win logic function)).
